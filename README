= Ruby font installer library

These files should help you (a programmer) to create a font installer
for TeX. 

The library is currently in alpha state, it is slow and inefficient.
The interface might change, but a lot of basic classes and methods are
available. See the example programs in the examples directory on how
to use the library. Also take a look at the Kpathsea and ENC classes
on how to make use of these.

== Installing a single font

=== Example usage to install a single font:
 font=Font.new
 font.load_variant("savorg__.afm")
 font.texenc=["ec","texnansi"]
 font.mapenc=["8r"]
 font.write_files

This will create virtual fonts for _ec_ and _texnansi_ encoding that
map to <em>8r</em> encoding, +tfm+ files for the _raw_ fonts and a +map+-file.

=== Synthesize small caps
Create a second variant, synthesize small caps and copy the relevant part
to the main font.
 f=Font.new
 f.texenc="ec"
 f.load_variant("savorg__.afm")
 fc = f.load_variant("savorg__.afm")
 f.fake_caps(fc,0.8)
 f.copy(fc,:lowercase)
 f.defaultfm.chars.apply_ligkern_instructions(RFI::STDLIGKERN)
 f.write_files



== Creating the documentation

You can generate the documentation of the classes and methods by
running Rdoc like this:

 rdoc --title "Ruby Font Installer Library" README lib/*rb 

This creates a directory +doc+ and a lot of html files. Open
+doc/index.html+ in your browser and voila, all classes and methods
documented. 

There is a +Makefile+ that takes care of generating the documentation.
